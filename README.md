## Description

A simple interactive dice game you can play with a friend. 

## Usage

ROLL DICE. Points rolled are accumulated in your "current score" until the player chooses to "HOLD" the "current score" and SAVE the points to the TOTAL SCORE counter OR a "1" is rolled in which case the "current score" is reset. Either of these actions will end the players turn and begin the other player's turn. The first player to reach a TOTAL SCORE of 100 wins the game! 

Click the "NEW GAME" button at any time to reset the game.
